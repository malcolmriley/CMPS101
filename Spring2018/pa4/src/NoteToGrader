I added functionality for most ordinary operations with Vectors - at least those that I was familiar with.
Added functionality:
	Complex -
	Rotation around origin - via rotate(float)
	Rotation around arbitrary point - via rotateAround(Vector, float)
	Finding angle between two vectors - via angleBetween(Vector)
	Finding the cross product of two vectors - via crossProduct(Vector)
	Simple -
	Finding the "slope" of a line from the origin to the vector (as a coordinate) - via slope()
	Cloning a Vector - via copy()
	Printing a Vector - via toString()

In testing, I discovered a few discrepancies between the values returned and the values I manually calculated. I believe these can be attributed to floating-point or rounding errors.
